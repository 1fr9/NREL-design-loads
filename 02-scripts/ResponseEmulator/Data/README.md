# Time series of response from openFAST simulations

The following files should be downloaded from the data repository, which is available at XXX, and should be placed in this folder:
 * OvrDataEmulatorDiffSeed.mat (overturning momemt time series of the 516 openFAST simulations; this Matlab workspace file contains the variable 'Ovr', which has a datastructure 
explained in the file FormatConventionForMomentTimeSeries.m . The time series are also available in ASCII format as 'overturning-moment-windspeed1.txt', 'overturning-moment-windspeed3.txt', ...)
 * BendingMoment.mat (14 additonal time series that used to analyze the approximation for the 10 m bending moment)
