# Time series of response from openFAST simulations

The following files should be downloaded from the data repository, which is available at XXX, and should place in this folder:
 * OvrDataEmulatorDiffSeed.mat (time series of the 516 openFAST simulations; this Matlab workspace file contains the variable 'Ovr', which has a datastructure 
explaine in the file FormatConventionForMomentTimeSeries.m .)
 * BendingMoment.mat (14 additonal time series that used to analyze the approximation for the 10 m bending moment)
