# Long-term extreme response of an offshore turbine

This GitHub repository belongs to the publication "Long-term extreme response of an 
offshore turbine: How accurate are contour-based estimates?" by Haselsteiner, Mackay, 
Frieling, Sander and Thoben.

It contains 
 * openFast input files (folder "01-simulations"), 
 * scripts that were used in the analysis of the study (folder "02-scripts"), 
 * structural properties of the turbine's tower (folder "03-tower") and 
 * figures (folders "02-scripts" and "04-handmade-figures"). 

Due to GitHub's file size restriction two datasets are available at a dedicated 
data repository: openfast's results and time series of environmental conditions.
The data repository is available at XXX.
These files must be placed into the two data folders of this repo that the scripts can run sucessfully. They be placed
* here: https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/2021-extreme-response/tree/master/02-scripts/EnvironmentalModel/Data and 
* here: https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/2021-extreme-response/tree/master/02-scripts/ResponseEmulator/Data
