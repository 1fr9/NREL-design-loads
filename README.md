# Long-term extreme response of an offshore turbine

This GitHub repository belongs to the publication "Long-term extreme response of an 
offshore turbine: How accurate are contour-based estimates?" by Haselsteiner, Mackay, 
Frieling, Sander and Thoben.

It contains openFast input files (folder "01_Simulations"), scripts that were used in the 
analysis of the study (folder "02_Scripts"), structural properties of the turbine and 
figures. Due to GitHub's file size restriction two datasets are available at a dedicated 
data repository: The simulation results and the artificial time series used in this study.
The data repository is available at XXX.
