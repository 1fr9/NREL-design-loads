# Long-term extreme response of an offshore turbine

This GitHub repository belongs to the publication "Long-term extreme response of an 
offshore turbine: How accurate are contour-based estimates?" by Haselsteiner, Mackay, 
Frieling, Sander and Thoben.

It contains openFast input files, scripts that were used in the analysis of the study and 
figures. Due to GitHub's file size restriction two datasets are available at a dedicated 
data repository: The simulation results and the artificial time series used in this study.
The data repository is available at XXX.
