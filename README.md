# Long-term extreme response of an offshore turbine

This GitHub repository belongs to the publication "Long-term extreme response of an 
offshore turbine: How accurate are contour-based estimates?" by Haselsteiner, Mackay, 
Frieling, Sander and Thoben.

It contains 
 * openFast input files (folder "01-simulations"), 
 * scripts that were used in the analysis of the study (folder "02-scripts"), 
 * structural properties of the turbine's tower (folder "03-tower") and 
 * figures (folders "02-scripts" and "04-handmade-figures"). 

Due to GitHub's file size restriction two datasets are available at a dedicated 
data repository: openfast's results and time series of environmental conditions.
The data repository is available at XXX.

We are aware that this repository is not fully self-explanatory.

Please reach out by email or by openening an issue in case you have any questions.
