# Time series of response from openFAST simulations
The time series of the 516 openFAST simulations are available at XXX.
The file is not in the GitHub repository, because it exceeds 100 MB.

Please unzip the file the, then you can load the .mat workspace.

This Matlab workspace file contains the variable 'Ovr', which has a datastructure 
explaine in the file FormatConventionForMomentTimeSeries.m .

## Additional simulations

14 additonal time series were simulated to analyze the approximation for the 
10 m bending moment. They are available at at XXX.
