# Scripts

We used Matlab and Python in the analysis of this study.

The scripts are categorized to wheter they were used to analyze the environmental data 
(folder "EnvironmentalModel") or the response (folder "ResponseEmulator").

When running the Matlab scripts, make sure that you execute the scripts while you are either 
in the "EnvironmentalModel" or "ResponseEmulator" folder such that file paths are correct.
